# Time Token Generation Configuration Template
# Copy and modify this file for your specific generation needs

# Model Configuration
model:
  # Option 1: Load from experiment (recommended)
  experiment: "097_modern_falcon-pretrain-lr0.2"

  # Option 2: Load from explicit paths
  # checkpoint_path: "/path/to/model.ckpt"
  # config_path: "/path/to/hparams.yaml"

# Data Configuration
data:
  # Person selection
  person_ids: []  # Specific person IDs (empty = random selection)
  num_people: 10  # Number of random people if person_ids is empty

# Generation Controls
generation:
  # Starting conditions (where to begin generation in sequence)
  start_condition:
    type: "age"     # Options: "age", "year", "index"
    value: 18       # Age 18, or year 2010, or sequence index 100

  # Stopping conditions (when to end generation)
  stop_condition:
    type: "tokens"  # Options: "tokens", "age", "year"
    value: 50       # Generate 50 tokens, or until age 25, or until year 2015

  # Multiple generations per prompt
  num_generations: 5  # Number of different sequences per person

  # Sampling parameters
  temperature: 1.0    # Sampling randomness (0.1 = conservative, 2.0 = creative)
  top_p: 0.9         # Top-p nucleus sampling

# Output Configuration
output:
  directory: "generated_time_tokens"
  filename: ""  # Auto-generated if empty
  include_human_readable: true

# System Configuration
system:
  device: "cuda"  # "cuda" or "cpu"
  seed: 42        # Random seed for reproducibility

# Example Configurations
# Uncomment and modify one of these sections:

# # Example 1: Generate early adulthood (18-25)
# generation:
#   start_condition: {type: "age", value: 18}
#   stop_condition: {type: "age", value: 25}
#   num_generations: 10
#   temperature: 0.8
#   top_p: 0.95

# # Example 2: Generate specific year span (2010-2015)
# generation:
#   start_condition: {type: "year", value: 2010}
#   stop_condition: {type: "year", value: 2015}
#   num_generations: 5
#   temperature: 1.2
#   top_p: 0.9

# # Example 3: Generate from middle of sequence
# generation:
#   start_condition: {type: "index", value: 500}
#   stop_condition: {type: "tokens", value: 100}
#   num_generations: 3
#   temperature: 1.0
#   top_p: 0.85

# Advanced Time Token Examples
# These require understanding of your specific time token vocabulary

# # Example 4: Childhood to adolescence
# generation:
#   start_condition: {type: "age", value: 5}
#   stop_condition: {type: "age", value: 16}
#   num_generations: 8
#   temperature: 0.9

# # Example 5: Career years
# generation:
#   start_condition: {type: "age", value: 22}
#   stop_condition: {type: "age", value: 65}
#   num_generations: 5
#   temperature: 1.1

# Notes:
# - Age tokens: AGE_0, AGE_1, ..., AGE_100
# - Year tokens: YEAR_1970, YEAR_1971, ..., YEAR_2030
# - Index starts at 0 (beginning of sequence)
# - Temperature: lower = more conservative, higher = more creative
# - Top-p: lower = more focused, higher = more diverse
